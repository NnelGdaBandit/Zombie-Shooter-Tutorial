## Unity Version

Unity 2021.3.5f1 - https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2021.3.5

It might work on earlier / later versions of unity but this is what I'm building the project with currently.

## Using

These are the project files for the game, you should just be able to open the project in Unity and play with them.

Feel free to use the scripts created for other projects.
